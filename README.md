# Arduino_STM32
Making STM32 great again!! LOL 
Well this project is all about using the existing IAR Embedded workbench and extending all the standard peripheral libraries in an Arduino
stype API format, while retaining maximum flexibility


# Pre-Requisites
- this works as a STANDALONE project with IAR and is configured to have the Libraries and Utilities folder for the device just before the 
project directory


THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS COLLABORATION IS MUCH APPRECIATED!!!
