# Arduino_STM32
Making STM32 great again!! LOL 
Well this project is all about using the existing IAR Embedded workbench and extending all the standard peripheral libraries in an Arduino
stype API format, while retaining maximum flexibility


# Pre-Requisites
- IAR Embedded Workbench
- ST discovery board or otherwise (STM32F0x compatible boards preferrably STM32F051x8 on which i have tested everything)


# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS COLLABORATION IS MUCH APPRECIATED!!!
- Sorry for being so loud but well its called shouting out for a reason :-D
