# Arduino_STM32
Making STM32 great again!! LOL 
Well this project is all about using the existing IAR Embedded workbench and extending all the standard peripheral libraries in an Arduino
stype API format, while retaining maximum flexibility


# Pre-Requisites
- this works as a STANDALONE project with IAR and is configured to have the stm32f0xx_stdperiph_lib/Libraries and stm32f0xx_stdperiph_lib/Utilities folder for the device just before the project directory or the folder where the repository is cloned.These folders are provided by ST micro from within the IAR Embedded Workbench


# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS COLLABORATION IS MUCH APPRECIATED!!!
